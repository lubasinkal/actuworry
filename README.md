# 🇧🇼 Botswana In-House Actuarial Solution

A working prototype of a locally-built actuarial system that simulates core insurance modeling tasks (pricing, reserving, forecasting) — traditionally outsourced to foreign providers. The tool is built to demonstrate that in-house actuarial technology is feasible, affordable, and aligned with local market needs.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Build a **minimum viable product (MVP)** of a performant and customizable actuarial engine that:

- Handles **product pricing**, **reserving**, and basic **forecasting** for insurers and brokers.
- Is **modular**, **transparent**, and based on **local assumptions** (e.g., Botswana-specific mortality).
- Can evolve into a production-ready enterprise tool using performant languages (e.g. Go, Rust).
- Demonstrates the potential for reducing long-term costs and reliance on black-box foreign tools.

## ✅ Core Features (MVP)

- 📊 **Life insurance pricing** engine (term, endowment, annuity support)
- 📉 **Reserve calculator** based on prospective actuarial formulas
- 📁 **Mortality table support** (local CSV uploads)
- 📈 **Visual outputs** for cashflows, reserves, and premiums
- 🧪 **Test suite** to ensure actuarial integrity
- 🌐 **Prototype UI**
